== The Fence ==

The Fence is an event calendar for Carnegie Mellon University. It's a project I started a few years ago and doesn't work at the moment.

Here's how you get it running:

1. Install [RVM](http://beginrescueend.com/)
2. Run the [project .rvmrc](http://beginrescueend.com/workflow/rvmrc/)
3. Run [bundle install](http://gembundler.com/)
4. Run the tests with `bundle exec rake spec`
5. Watch them fail
